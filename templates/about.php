    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
        Hi, I'm Sam Tay. I was recently hired by Blue Acorn as a PHP Developer Apprentice. This is my blog application
        developed as an exercise in using a LAMP stack and the MVC pattern. This framework was written from
        scratch, however I did have help with the design. This webpage was built using <a href="http://getbootstrap
        .com/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>. I will compile a list of other great resources here soon.
