        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sam Tay. I was recently hired by Blue Acorn as a PHP Developer Apprentice. This
            is my blog application developed as an exercise in using a LAMP stack and the MVC pattern. This framework
            was written from scratch, however I did have <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">help</a> with the design. I
            will compile a list of other great resources here soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I am an avid climber. When I'm not climbing or coding, I enjoy surfing, backpacking,
            reading, and playing videogames.
