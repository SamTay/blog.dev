            <p>A couple of months back I took delivery of my new solo size cuben fiber ground sheet from ZPacks. I had been wanting to pick one of these up for quite a while, and finally got around to getting one. The reason that I wanted it was so that I could carry the ground sheet to use with my Hexamid Solo Plus tarp when bugs are not an issue, and I can leave the Hexanet behind. Why? Well, to simplify things, and to save some weight… of course!</p>

             <p>Once I got the ground sheet, I added six tie outs, made of 3/32″ shock cord, a mitten hook, and a mini cord lock. I also grabbed a mini cuben fiber stuff stack (from ZPacks) that I had lying around to store the ground sheet in. After adding in these pieces, the total weight of my ground sheet came to 3.5 oz. Sure, there are lighter options, such as a piece of cut down polycro which weighs 1 oz, however, (believe it or not) this was not all about weight… I choose the ZPacks ground sheet for its bathtub floor!</p>

              <p>Some may remember a past trip in which I reported waking up in a rather deep puddle… Of course, this was my fault from the get-go… I should have chosen a better site (which is the first rule when using a tarp), but I didn’t. And I feel like if I would have had a groundsheet with a bathtub floor such as the ZPacks ground sheet, then I would have fared a little better… although, in that case, it still would have ended bad…</p>

               <p>Anyway… since getting the ground sheet, I have used it under my Hexamid tarp two nights on a recent hike to Savage Gulf.</p>

            <p>The ground sheet worked great, however, after using it, I realized some things that I did not think of
                before…</p>

            <p>I would like to use the ground sheet in place of the Hexanet when bugs are not an issue, which is during the cooler months. But, in the cooler months, I will be carrying a bit more gear than I would in warmer weather (more clothes, thicker air pad, loftier sleeping bag, etc…) So, my “problem” that I ran into is that I like to keep my extra gear with me, inside the shelter, and well, that can fill the solo sized ground sheet a bit quick… (See the photo above.) This is an issue, at least for me… I still have to put my 200 lb, 5’10″ body in there with the rest of my gear! But, as I found on my recent hike with it, I do still fit, along with my other items around me, I just wasn’t exactly thrilled about it. So, this is definitely a personal issue, as opposed to a product issue.</p>

            <p>Anyway, I do like the ground sheet, but I think if I am going to use it more, at least during the cooler months, I will simply have to start putting my “extra” gear back in my backpack, and just hang it from a tree or something outside. This isn’t really a problem, as I have done this quite a bit before, but since using my Hexanet, I guess I have become a bit spoiled with all the interior room, and being able to spread out all of my gear inside with me… Well, either that, or just get the Duplex….  :)</p>

            <p>So,  how about the weight savings?</p>

            <p>My Hexanet, with all cords and stuff sack, comes in at 9.5 oz. As I said above, the ground sheet, with all cords and stuff sack comes to 3.6 oz. This gives me a 5.9 oz total weight savings… which is nothing to sneeze at! So, because of the weight savings, as well as the awesome design of the ground sheet itself, I am going to see what I can do to continue to use it… even in the cooler months! But, now I have to wait a while as the cooler weather is finally moving out, and the bugs are taking its place… so, it’s back to the Hexanet for now. (Although, I am not complaining about that either…)</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
