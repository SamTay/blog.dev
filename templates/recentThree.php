            <p>So,  how about the weight savings?</p>

            <p>My Hexanet, with all cords and stuff sack, comes in at 9.5 oz. As I said above, the ground sheet, with all cords and stuff sack comes to 3.6 oz. This gives me a 5.9 oz total weight savings… which is nothing to sneeze at! So, because of the weight savings, as well as the awesome design of the ground sheet itself, I am going to see what I can do to continue to use it… even in the cooler months! But, now I have to wait a while as the cooler weather is finally moving out, and the bugs are taking its place… so, it’s back to the Hexanet for now. (Although, I am not complaining about that either…)</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
