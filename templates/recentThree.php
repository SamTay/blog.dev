            <p>A couple of months back I took delivery of my new solo size cuben fiber ground sheet from ZPacks. I had been wanting to pick one of these up for quite a while, and finally got around to getting one. The reason that I wanted it was so that I could carry the ground sheet to use with my Hexamid Solo Plus tarp when bugs are not an issue, and I can leave the Hexanet behind. Why? Well, to simplify things, and to save some weight… of course!</p>

             <p>Once I got the ground sheet, I added six tie outs, made of 3/32″ shock cord, a mitten hook, and a mini cord lock. I also grabbed a mini cuben fiber stuff stack (from ZPacks) that I had lying...</p>

            <p>The ground sheet worked great, however, after using it, I realized some things that I did not think of
                before…</p>

            <p>I would like to use the ground sheet in place of the Hexanet when bugs are not an issue, which is during the cooler months. But, in the cooler months, I will be carrying a bit more gear than I would in warmer weather (more clothes, thicker air pad, loftier sleeping bag, etc…) So, my “problem” that I ran into is that I like to keep my extra gear with me, inside the shelter, and well, that can fill the solo sized ground sheet a bit quick… (See the photo above.) This is an issue, at least for me… I still have to put my 200 lb, 5’10″ body in there with the rest of my gear! But, as I found...</p>

            <p>So,  how about the weight savings?</p>

            <p>My Hexanet, with all cords and stuff sack, comes in at 9.5 oz. As I said above, the ground sheet, with all cords and stuff sack comes to 3.6 oz. This gives me a 5.9 oz total weight savings… which is nothing to sneeze at! So, because of the weight savings, as well as the awesome design of the ground sheet itself, I am going to see what I can do to continue to use it… even in the cooler months! But, now I have to wait a while as the cooler weather is finally moving out, and the bugs are taking its place… so, it’s back to the Hexanet for now. (Although, I am not complaining about that either…)</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading!</p>
